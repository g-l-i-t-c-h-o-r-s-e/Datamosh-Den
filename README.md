I included a build of MEncoder, MPlayer and more. The MPlayer devs at some point changed how MEncoder/MPlayer handles vfw(Video For Windows) video codecs; but I found a [forum post]( https://spreadys.wordpress.com/2013/03/29/imm4-codec-and-mencoder/) that explains this and links a working MEncoder build compatible with vfw codecs. I already provided that MEncoder build in this repository but if you want to see it for yourself the link is in [here]( https://app.box.com/v/Spreadys), password is: validate
